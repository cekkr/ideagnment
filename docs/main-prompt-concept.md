Create the projectual roadmap to build this protocol, aiming to "align" AI model (especially locally) to create a software able to enforce cohesion of ideas in complex projects:

### The Prompt for the Reasoning Model

**Role:** You are a Principal Systems Architect and Cognitive Scientist specializing in Distributed Intelligence and Privacy-Preserving AI.

**Objective:** Create a comprehensive technical and conceptual roadmap for a **"Semantic Alignment Protocol" (SAP)**. This is not a simple chatbot, but a background layer for communication platforms (e.g., local email/messaging clients) designed to align individual contributions with collective goals in complex scientific and technological environments.

**The Vision:**
In high-complexity fields, no single individual holds the "full picture." Communication often fails due to unstated assumptions, divergent mental models, and the "friction of entry" for outsiders with rare but valuable insights. The SAP acts as a pre-emptive mediator that analyzes a user's draft *before* it is sent, comparing it against a local knowledge base of the group’s shared context, conflicting viewpoints, and project goals.

**Key Requirements & Constraints:**

1. **Local-First & Privacy-Preserving:** The system must operate on local LLMs to handle sensitive, "intrusive" personal data (drafts, notes, previous interactions) without cloud exposure. Use techniques like Local RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and Federated Context.
2. **The "Before-Send" Alignment:** The protocol must detect "Semantic Gaps" (where the sender assumes knowledge the recipient lacks) and "Expectation Mismatches" (where the proposal contradicts group constraints).
3. **Preservation of Divergent Thought:** It must prevent "groupthink." It should highlight "rare thoughts" from non-insiders, explaining how their unique perspective fits into the larger puzzle rather than forcing them to conform.
4. **Cohesion without Centralization:** Design a way for the AI to map the "Whole Picture" by synthesizing fragmented contributions from different team members without requiring a central "master" authority.

**Requested Output Structure:**

1. **Phase 1: Knowledge Architecture.** How to map individual and group "mental models" locally (e.g., Knowledge Graphs, Vector embeddings of unstated assumptions).
2. **Phase 2: The Alignment Logic.** Define the algorithms for "Conflict Detection" and "Idea Injection." How does the AI decide when to intervene without being intrusive?
3. **Phase 3: UX & The "Invisibility" Layer.** How to present "the unspoken" to the user (e.g., heatmaps of understanding, suggestion overlays) to lower friction and improve project cohesion.
4. **Phase 4: Optimization for Local Constraints.** Strategies for running these complex reasoning tasks on limited local hardware (quantization, task-specific micro-agents).
5. **Phase 5: Ethical & Social Framework.** How to ensure the tool fosters genuine human understanding rather than just "AI-optimized" corporate speak.
